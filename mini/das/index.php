			<p class="text-justify">Blood is universally recognized as the most precious element that sustains life. It saves innumerable lives across the world in a variety of conditions. The need for blood is great - on any given day, approximately 39,000 units of Red Blood Cells are needed. More than 29 million units of blood components are transfused every year.
